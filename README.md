Features
Dynamic Routing: Route requests to different backend services based on predefined rules.
Filtering: Apply filters to modify or augment incoming requests and outgoing responses.
Load Balancing: Distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a service for improved scalability and reliability.
Integration with Spring Ecosystem: Seamlessly integrate with other Spring projects such as Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for enhanced functionality.
